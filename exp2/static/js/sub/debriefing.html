		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to our understanding of cognitive effort. </p>

		<p>The purpose of this study was to invesigate how progress contributes to
       how people view cognitive effort. Cognitive effort is usually thought of as
       the amount of mental energy needed to accomplish some task. Generally speaking,
       effort is usually thought of as aversive -- people tend to avoid spending it in most
       day-to-day tasks. However, we still use effort all the time because it usually confers some benefit.
       For example, we may spend a lot of mental effort studying for an exam, because doing so will secure us
      a good grade. </p>

    <p> That being said, there are some situations where people think of effort a bit differently. For instance,
    when someone plays Sodoku, they do so because effort <i>itself</i> is rewarding, <b>not</b> necessarily because
    it gets them any particular reward. </p>

    <p>In this study, we hypothesized that one of the reasons for this difference is <b>progress</b>. In this study, when you chose a deck, you were really choosing between two versions of the main task. There were six decks to choose from, and thus six versions of the task: An easy version with no progress bar, a medium version with no progress bar, a hard version with no progress bar, and equivalent versions with a progress bar. 
    We hypothesized that people would be more willing to choose the harder versions of the task when it also came with progress compared to when it did not. This would suggest that people are more willing to engage in more mental effort when progress is present (like when people play Sodoku).</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
		principal investigator, Sean Devine (seandamiandevine@gmail.com).</p>
